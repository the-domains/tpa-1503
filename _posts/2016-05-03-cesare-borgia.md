I met Cesare Borgia. The second most powerful man in all of Italia, he wanted nothing more than to return Leonardo to, what he believes, is his rightful place - by Cesare's side.

I took Leonardo to visit some villages, as my usual weekly rounds had begun. I asked him to come along, because I knew that inquisitive Leonardo would find this different culture quite fascinating, and he would appreciate dearly me taking him on such a trip. 

But then, we were taken. Travelling from one village to the next, we were overwhelmed by an ambush and overpowered quite quickly. Leonardo yelled 'pistola' and I knew immediately to proceed with caution. He had told me of his forced design of the new weapon that could kill in the blink of an eye. I had not the means to stop such a force, nor the ability to root or subdue the sheer number of Cesare's people. No, instead, we were forced to surrender, and so, we were taken to Italia.

Cesare Borgia is a powerful man. A human, in a human-dense nation, his father the Pope - a sole King with more power and influence than a Seraeni King. I knew, upon entering the Palazza, what power really meant. But Cesare Borgia was not a foolish man, and perhaps I was. Soldiers upon soldiers, guards upon guards, stationed at the side of the Grand Hall. Perhaps I was driven by compassion, or perhaps it was a foolish pride, but as they pushed Leonardo around, I took action. I subdued the four guards who held us. I thought, since we were bound by our wrists with mere rope and not the cruel, but effective preferred methods of Bryan Trevell, that perhaps these humans had never encountered a stronger Protean, one with a decent command of his abilities. I thought wrong. I had pride and ambition that almost cost me everything.

Cesare and his guard were quick to respond. Immediately, they swept me off the ground and brought my wrists to the front. The next thing I knew, I was on the floor with my arms stretched painfully forward, one guard holding me down and the other pulling on my restraints. I remember giant footsteps, slow but heavy, approaching me. The sound of metal scraping past metal as he pulled his broadsword from the sheath and the insanity lacing every single one of Cesare's words; "Now you will see what we do with Proteans who believe themselves better than us." 

The sword came down, flying through the air, and as I screamed I pulled on the rope as hard as was possible, but it would not budge. I was going to lose my hands this very moment. The loudest clang as the sword all but crashed on the stone floor was followed by my arms flying towards me, the force of me pulling back suddenly released. I was afraid to open my eyes. I felt numb, frightened, and sick. 

"Oh, grazie..." Leonardo's voice sounded relieved, and I needed to see why. As I opened my eyes, I saw my fingers still on my hands, my hands still on my wrists. I moved them, and my fingers obeyed my body's request. 

Though I had not lost my hands, I knew now how Cesare Borgia was able to restrain Proteans with only rope, and only by their wrists - the fear I felt that day was greater than I had ever felt before and greater still than I would ever feel since.
